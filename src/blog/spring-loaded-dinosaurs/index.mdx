# Spring-Loaded Dinosaurs: Tendons as Biological Energy Storage

<date>28 Feb 2026</date>

Dinosaurs were not slow, lumbering lizards. The largest animals to ever walk on land moved with a mechanical elegance that required something subtle and counterintuitive: **they ran on springs**.

Not metaphorical springs. Literal elastic energy storage in tendons — the same physics as a pogo stick, but evolved over hundreds of millions of years into one of the most energy-efficient locomotion systems ever built.

## The Problem with Being Enormous

Consider a 50-tonne *Argentinosaurus*. Every step, it must:

1. Decelerate a limb swinging forward (costs energy)
2. Absorb the impact of its body weight hitting the ground
3. Accelerate the limb back into the next step

At that mass, doing all of this with muscle alone is thermodynamically catastrophic. Muscle converts chemical energy to force, but it's lossy — about 75% of the energy becomes heat. If every footfall had to be powered entirely by fresh chemical energy, the animal would need to eat almost continuously just to walk.

The math is brutal. A rough estimate for metabolic cost of locomotion:

```
E_step ≈ m × g × Δh + ½ × m × Δv²
```

Where `Δh` is the vertical oscillation of the centre of mass per step and `Δv` is the speed change. For a 50,000 kg animal taking 1-metre strides with even 5 cm of vertical oscillation, that's ~24,500 J per step — **just from gravitational potential alone**.

At a walking pace of one step per two seconds, that's ~12 kW of sustained power output just for vertical oscillation. Real animals use far less. The gap is tendons.

## Hooke's Law Inside a Leg

A tendon is collagen fibres arranged in parallel — dense, fibrous, and elastic. When stretched, it stores energy like a spring:

```
E_stored = ½ × k × x²
```

where `k` is the stiffness of the tendon and `x` is the stretch distance.

Critically, tendons are **remarkably efficient springs**. Their energy return ratio (energy out / energy in) is around **93%** in living animals. Compare that to 25% for a muscle contraction. If you can load a tendon during one phase of a stride and unload it during another, you have essentially free energy recycling — nearly 93 cents back for every dollar spent.

This is the principle behind the **spring-mass model** of locomotion: the body acts as a mass bouncing on a spring (the leg), and the spring stores energy at impact and releases it at push-off.

## Evidence in Bone: The Fossil Record Tells Us Where Tendons Were

We can't fossilize soft tissue directly, but tendons leave signatures:

### Ossified Tendons

Many dinosaurs — particularly ornithopods like *Iguanodon* and *Edmontosaurus* — had **ossified tendons** running along the spine and tail. These were tendons that calcified over time, becoming identifiable fossil material.

Their arrangement suggests they acted as tension members, stiffening the back against the bending moments generated by locomotion. A stiff back transmits force more efficiently from hindlimbs to the rest of the body — the same principle as a rigid bicycle frame.

### Muscle Attachment Scars

Large muscle attachment scars on femora and tibiae of theropods indicate enormous hindlimb muscles — but the *position* of these scars tells us something more. In birds (the living descendants of theropods), the large leg muscles sit high on the thigh, far from the foot. The actual mechanical work of moving the foot is done by long tendons running down the leg.

This arrangement trades speed for efficiency: you move a small mass (the tendon) instead of a large mass (the muscle belly) at high velocity. The muscles act as slow, powerful motors; the tendons transmit force to where it's needed.

*Tyrannosaurus rex* had this same architecture. Its massive calf muscles sat proximally. Its foot was moved largely by tendons.

### The Achilles Analogue

In *T. rex*, the equivalent of the Achilles tendon has been estimated at stiffnesses that could store hundreds of kilojoules per step at running speeds. Whether *T. rex* actually ran (vs. fast-walked) is still debated, but the tendon architecture was there.

## Sauropods: The Suspension Bridge Strategy

Sauropods present a different problem. Their necks — up to 15 metres in *Mamenchisaurus* — had to be held horizontal for grazing, sometimes for hours at a time.

Holding a 500 kg neck horizontal using muscle alone would require constant, expensive isometric contraction. Instead, sauropod necks used a **ligament-based suspension system** analogous to a suspension bridge:

```
         Dorsal ligament (tension member)
    ___/‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾\___
   /                                        \
  [Hips]----[vertebrae as compression members]----[Skull]
```

The nuchal ligament ran along the top of the neck. Vertebrae were the compression struts. The whole assembly behaved as a pre-stressed cable structure. Muscles were needed only to *change* the neck's position — not to hold it.

Fossilised neck vertebrae in sauropods show the attachment points for exactly this kind of ligament system: large neural spines on the dorsal side of each vertebra, optimally positioned for a tension cable running above.

## The Kangaroo Comparison: Tendons Proven in Vivo

We don't have to speculate entirely. Living animals provide a proof of concept.

Kangaroos get *more efficient* at higher hopping speeds — the opposite of what you'd expect from a pure muscle model. At 12 km/h they use roughly the same metabolic rate as at 20 km/h. The reason: their massive Achilles tendons store more energy per stride at higher speeds, offsetting the increased mechanical demand.

Measurements with implanted force buckles and ultrasound show that kangaroo tendons recoil in under 100 milliseconds, returning ~93% of stored energy. The muscle barely changes length during a hop — it acts as an isometric strut while the tendon does the elastic work.

Ostriches show the same pattern. Their leg muscles are small relative to body size, but their digital flexor tendons are enormous. An ostrich's tendons can store ~60% of the mechanical energy needed for each stride.

Since ostriches are ratites — large, flightless birds — and birds are living theropod dinosaurs, this is direct evidence of what the theropod lineage was capable of.

## The Resonance Problem: Stride Frequency and Natural Frequency

A spring-mass system has a natural frequency:

```
f_natural = (1/2π) × √(k/m)
```

For efficient elastic energy recycling, you want to stride at or near this natural frequency. If you stride too fast or too slow, the tendons don't complete their elastic cycle in sync with the mechanical cycle and you lose energy.

This is one reason why stride frequency in large animals scales predictably with body size — larger animals have stiffer tendons (higher k) but much larger mass (higher m), and the two effects partially cancel, but not perfectly. The result is the well-known **dynamic similarity** across locomoting animals: when scaled by leg length, many animals choose stride frequencies that keep their Froude numbers similar.

Large dinosaurs would have faced the same constraint. Their tendons would have needed to be tuned — in terms of stiffness, length, and cross-sectional area — to their stride frequency at their preferred locomotion speed. Paleontologists can infer preferred speed from trackways, and then backsolve for what tendon parameters would have made elastic storage efficient.

## Why This Changes How We Think About Dinosaur Energetics

The traditional debate was: warm-blooded vs. cold-blooded dinosaurs. Endotherm vs. ectotherm. This framing treats metabolism as the only variable.

But locomotion efficiency changes the equation. An animal with 93%-return elastic energy storage needs dramatically less metabolic energy to move than one without it. A sauropod with a well-tuned spring system might have had metabolic requirements closer to a large mammal than its size would naively suggest — not because it was endothermic, but because it was mechanically efficient.

Conversely, a poorly-tuned spring system would demand more metabolic input to compensate. The evolutionary pressure on tendon architecture was intense precisely because the energetic stakes were high.

## Modern Engineering Echoes

The engineering world keeps rediscovering this. Boston Dynamics' robots use elastic elements in their legs explicitly to recover energy between strides. ATLAS stores energy in leg springs during impact and releases it at push-off, cutting motor power requirements significantly.

Prosthetic running blades (carbon fibre C-shaped springs) allow amputee sprinters to run faster than the metabolic cost would predict — the blade returns ~90% of energy, similar to biological tendons.

We keep building what evolution already found.

## Summary

1. Large body mass makes tendon-based elastic energy storage energetically necessary, not merely helpful
2. Tendons return ~93% of stored energy — far exceeding muscle efficiency
3. Fossil evidence (ossified tendons, muscle attachment geometry, neural spine morphology) confirms dinosaurs had extensive tendon-based systems
4. Living theropods (ostriches, emus) demonstrate the system in action, with measurable in-vivo energy return
5. Stride frequency tuning to tendon natural frequency is a real constraint that shapes locomotion across all spring-mass animals
6. Dinosaur energetics debates that ignore mechanical efficiency are missing a major term in the equation

*The bones are the frame. The tendons were the engine.*
