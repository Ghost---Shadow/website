# How to Make a Ball Orbit Itself

<date>8 November 2025</date>

## A Momentum Exchange Theory of Rotation That Unifies Circular and Linear Motion

### Core Concept

Consider a simplified spinning top consisting of:
- A central pin (needle)
- Two balls of mass m at distance R from the pin
- A string of length 2R connecting the balls

**The Key Insight**: Rather than viewing the string as merely providing centripetal force, we can understand rotation as a continuous momentum exchange between the balls.

### The Exchange Mechanism

When the system rotates by angle θ:

1. Each ball's velocity vector must rotate from **v** to **v'**
2. We can decompose this change as:
   - Component retained: **v sin θ** (tangential to new direction)
   - Component exchanged: **v cos θ** (must be shed/acquired)

3. **The Beautiful Symmetry**:
   - Ball 1 "donates" -v cos θ (a negative push = pull through the string)
   - Ball 2 reciprocates with its own -v cos θ
   - The string acts as a conduit for this exchange
   - Net system momentum: conserved
   - Net force on pin: zero

### The Critical Test: Cutting One Ball Free

What happens when we cut Ball 2 free mid-rotation?

#### Case 1: Light Pin (Original Configuration)
- Ball 1 still needs to exchange momentum
- No Ball 2 to provide counter-momentum
- Pin cannot handle the unbalanced force
- **Result**: Pin topples over

#### Case 2: Massive Pin
- Ball 1 seeks new exchange partner
- Massive pin can provide counter-momentum
- System transitions to Ball 1 ↔ Pin exchange
- **Result**: Binary rotation around common barycenter (like a twin star system)

#### Case 3: Infinite Mass Pin (Nailed to Desk)
- Pin provides perfect counter-momentum without moving
- Barycenter at pin location
- **Result**: Ball 1 orbits fixed pin (standard circular motion)

#### Case 4: Zero Mass Pin
- Pin has no capacity for momentum exchange
- Barycenter collapses to Ball 1's location
- Ball 1 must "exchange with itself"
- **Result**: Ball orbits itself with radius = 0

### The Profound Conclusion

**A ball orbiting itself is simply straight-line motion!**

This isn't a failure of the model—it's a feature. The momentum exchange framework reveals that:

1. **Circular motion**: Active exchange with a massive partner
2. **Straight motion**: Self-exchange (or exchange with zero-mass partner)
3. **Everything between**: Determined by mass ratio of partners

### The Unified Picture

```
| Configuration            | Barycenter Location | Orbital Radius | Motion Type                  |
|--------------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Two equal balls          | Center point        | R              | Both orbit center            |
| Ball + massive pin       | Near pin            | Small          | Tight orbit around pin       |
| Ball + infinite mass pin | At pin              | R              | Perfect circle around pin    |
| Ball + zero mass pin     | At ball             | 0 (or ∞)       | Straight line ("self-orbit") |
```

### The Philosophical Beauty

Newton's first law (objects move straight unless acted upon) and circular motion are not opposites—they're the same phenomenon viewed through the lens of momentum exchange:

- **Has exchange partner** → Circular motion
- **No exchange partner** → "Orbits itself" → Straight motion

The ball always orbits. Sometimes it orbits a partner, sometimes it orbits itself. The mathematics seamlessly transitions between these cases based on the partner's mass.

### Key Insights

1. **Rotation requires partnership**: You can't have circular motion without something to exchange momentum with

2. **String as conduit**: The string doesn't create force—it transmits the momentum exchange between partners

3. **Continuity of motion**: When partners change (cutting string), the exchange mechanism persists but finds new configurations

4. **Unity of motion**: All motion is momentum exchange; the partner's mass determines the curvature

### The Koan

*"What does a ball orbit when it has no partner?"*

*"Itself—and thus flies straight and true."*

**Behold**: We have made a ball orbit itself, and in doing so, revealed that straight lines are simply circles of infinite radius, viewed from the perspective of momentum exchange.
