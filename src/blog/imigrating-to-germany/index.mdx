# The Journey from India to Germany: A Guide for IT Professionals

<date>20 June 2023</date>

## Understanding the Immigration Process

Embarking on an international move can be a daunting task, particularly when it involves navigating through the intricate immigration process. Here, I've compiled a step-by-step guide for my fellow IT professionals considering a move from India to Germany.

Before you start, it's important to ensure all your necessary documents are in order. Be sure to have at least two printed copies of each document, alongside the original. You may find that the printing costs add up, amounting to roughly around 300 INR in total.

One essential tip is to initiate the health insurance process as early as possible, as it might take some time. More information on this can be found on the official website [here](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/2535038).

### Key Documentation

* **Make sure your degree is from a university that is recognized by Germany** - Your university AND the degree must be in the [Anabin](https://anabin.kmk.org/no_cache/filter/institutionen.html) database.
This [website](https://www.welcome-hub-germany.com/blog/anabin) does a very good job in explaining the process. Take a print out of both and carry 2 copies.
* **Degree certificate itself** - Carry original and 2 copies. Provisional degree certificate is not accepted. 
* **Physically mailed job offer** - Your employer needs to physically mail the job application. Keep original and 2 copies.
* **Pre-approval by the Federal Employment Agency** - Needs to be done by employer and physically mailed. Keep original and 2 copies.
* **Travel health insurance** - I got mine from reliance travel insurance and carried it to the interview before approval. Link [here](https://www.reliancegeneral.co.in/Insurance/Travel-Insurance/Schengen-Travel-Insurance.aspx)
* **Certificate about health insurance** - You have to get an acknowledgement from an health insurance provider that they have started the process and have issued a number. Go [here](https://www.tk.de/service/app/2055914/contact/contact.app) to start the process. The link I have provided is the "official" German health insurance and I would recommend it. 
Keep your employer in loop. 2 copies of online printout is enough. The letter should have the registration number.
* **Proof of qualification and experience certificates for future employment in Germany** - I dont remember what this was. I also carried my termination letter from my previous employer, maybe that was enough.

The remaining are easy

* **Passport** - Carry original. I did color printout, but I think black and white should be fine. First page and last page. Two copies each.
* **Application form** - Carry 2 copies. Check official [page](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/2535038).
* **Declaration form** - Carry 2 copies. Check official [page](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/2535038).
* **Annexure for employment visa** - Carry 2 copies. Check official [page](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/2535038).
* **Passport photos** - Carry 2 copies. 
* **Your resume/CV** - Carry 2 copies. The officer didnt read it.

The video provided below goes into depth. It is what I primarily followed for getting my VISA, however it does not talk about the health insurance.

### Points to note

* **Demand Draft from SBI is not accepted** - When I printed my SBI demand draft, the address was broken and seemed to be misprinted. So, I immediately asked the bank teller to regenerate the draft, it came back with the same misprint. 
* **Cash is accepted but don't risk it** - For the VISA process, they accepted payment in cash, but it might differ from counter to counter.  would recommend against risking it. Keep the cash handy in **exact** denomination, just in case. Luckily I happened to have the exact denomination.
* **Do not bookmark the login page of VISA website** - The login page uses some personally identifiable information in the URL. It broke my account and I had to register with a new email.
* **Help desk on India side is very unresponsive** - They do not acknowledge mails or pick up phone.

Most of the issues I had if the VISA process could have been prevented if there was a pre-approval step. Lets say you upload the scanned copy of all your documents that will be required during the interview. Someone will then pre-flag anything problematic. If nothing gets flagged, then you show up for the interview with the original documents. Having this pre-approval step along with online payment could have mitigated all the anxiety.

### Timeline

* Getting an appointment - 15 days
* Getting response from health insurance - 14 days (can be done in parallel)
* Getting the mail to collect the VISA - 4 hours

## Things to know before moving

### Apartment search

Germany uses SCHUFA credit check and will not accept CIBIL score. You cannot get a SCHUFA credit check unless you have a German bank account. You cannot get a German bank account unless you have a German address. You cannot get an apartment in Germany without a SCHUFA credit check.

The last point is not entirely true, there are some landlords who will accept people without credit check. I did manage to get one eventually. I sent 75 applications on [immobilienscout24.de](immobilienscout24.de) and got replies from 2. Some of my German colleagues told me that I was paying the rent equivalent of a two bedroom apartment for a studio apartment. As someone who is used to the Bangalore rent, it didnt bother me too much.

There are two reasons why it is harder for Indians to find apartments in Germany
* **Landlord cannot use force to evict you in case you fail to pay rent** - One of my German colleagues told me that the landlords cannot call police to evict you in case you fail to produce rent due to loss of job or otherwise. Which sounds great in theory, but in reality it means that nobody wants to take risk unless they are extremely certain. *I was unable to fact check this.*
* **Centralized kitchen chimneys** - This is the more likely reason why Indians are avoided. Since Germany is a cold country, you cannot open the window and let the kitchen fumes out. All homes have kitchen chimneys. Many of these chimneys link together before venting out. The problem starts when you fry onions or other spicy food. The spice fumes might start irritating other apartment dwellers due to the internet of chimneys.

A better alternative is to register yourself in the apartment of a German colleague but live in a hotel or Airbnb until you find a permenent address.

Another alternative is to find an apartment in Berlin on temporary, register your Berlin address, make a bank account and get SCHUFA. Then start searching for an apartment near your work. You can negotiate a work from home with your employer during this time. [Here](https://www.moveto-berlin.com/en/) is a website which can help you do it this way.

### Carry some antibiotics

In Germany you usually need an appointment before you can get a doctor. I havent seen any walk-in private practice. Even hospitals dont do walk in.

In case of minor diseases like a stomach infection, you have to call a private practice, get an appointment and visit there. Usually you get a date within 7 days. However, for one doctor, the receptionist told me that the earliest date was in 2 months.

Ambulances are free, but the hospital can deem that you do not need an ambulance and can reject you. Get a German colleague to call on your behalf or drive you to the hospital.

### Get a prepaid forex card

It will be a while until you have a bank account and debit card in Germany. Until then get a forex card from your Indian bank account. I loaded 2000 EUR, only used up 500 EUR until my German debit card was ready.

## Tips after moving

### Get a tourist SIM ASAP

Just because you paid for international roaming on your Indian SIM card does not mean that you are going to get mobile data. Calls work, mobile data doesnt. If you are doing an Europe trip, you have to get a tourist SIM for each country you visit. Fortunately, they are very cheap and you can get one from airports in less than a minute. They just ask to see your passport.

### No Uber in most places

Uber is banned in Germany. Taxi service isnt great either. The rail and tram network is extremely comprehensive and frequent. This is easily one of the best things about living in Germany.

### Anmeldung

Anmeldung or registration is something you need to do after you land. You need the Anmeldung confirmation to create bank account. It is done in a place called Burgeramt. Depending on the city you can do it walk in or you need an appointment. There is a corresponding mandatory Abmeldung or deregistration when you move out or relocate.

### Bank account

N26 bank bank operator told me that India is blacklisted.

Any brick and mortar bank is fine. I used Sparkasse, I would definitely recommend it.

You just need to show up at the bank with Anmeldung and passport to create an account.

### Auslanderbehorde

You will only get a 6 month VISA from the India embassy, you have to convert it to a 3 year permit (if you have a blue card). This is done by contacting the Auslanderbehorde. Ask your employer for your point of contact. The point of contact will guide you through the process. You should already have all the documents that are going to be requested. I no longer remember the list of documents requested.

They will then call you for an appointment and you have to be there physically. Carry a German debit card (EC card) to make payment.

During the appointment they will give you a paper with instructions. Go to the website and enter the OTP printed on the paper. You should get your blue card by mail. Until your blue card arrives you will be given a paper confirmation extending your residence permit, however I am not sure if this paper confirmation will be accepted by airport authorities. So, avoid leaving the country until the card arrives.

For me the entire process took a few months. It was during COVID, so services might be affected.

### Health 

* **Don't get hit by a car until the health insurance card arrives** - It can take a few weeks until the physical health insurance card arrives. Your travel insurance only covers travel and will not be accepted by the German health care system. You can ask for a paper confirmation from TK until the card arrives. This can be shown at clinics.
* **Do not cross the zebra crossing while the pedestrian light is red** - The insurance will not pay if the light was red. Also the cars drive so fast that they cant stop in time. Cars drive really fast, just because you cant see or hear them, doesnt mean that they dont exist. Obey the red light.
* **Buy gloves, wear muffler and do not drink iced breverages** - Not to sound like your mom, but these are the common attack vectors why people get sick. I never got sick in over a year after I followed these three simple rules.
* **Buy two thin jackets instead of one thick jacket** - Wear both in winter, only one in Spring and Autumn. Also, indoor temperature varies wildly, you can peel off layers depending on what the termostat is set to.
* **CRP test** - Due to the free nature of health insurance, the doctors have to make sure that the patient claiming to be sick is actually sick. The C-Reactive Protein test is for that purpose. The problem with any test is that they have both false negative and false positive. My CRP test kept coming back false positive for months and it freaked out the doctors.
* **Dont be shy with the heater** - Even if it costs more, set it to a temperature you are comfortable with. Being sick, all alone in a foreign country is not fun.

### Groceries

I spend 40-50 EUR on food every week. I dont check the price of things before I put it in my basket. However, I am a 5 feet 1 inch sedentary IT guy who weights 45-50 kg.

Buy one of these [trolley bags](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B071HLY5GM/). It helps a lot in hauling groceries if you are using public transport instead of your own car.

Buy some vitamin D and drink plenty of milk. Its quite easy to find lactose free milk.

Buy a rice cooker.

There are Asian supermarkets where you can buy vacuum sealed Indian food like frozen paratha and dal makhni.

## Exit process

There are a few things you need to do before you leave Germany.

I availed the services of [deregistration.de](https://deregistration.de) who are a private firm who help you with deregistration.

I followed their instructions and nothing out of the ordinary happened.

If you want to transfer money back to India, use the `P1301 - Inward remittance from Indian non residents towards family maintenance and savings` inward remmitance code. There is no tax on this, you should get a small service charge from your bank.

Sparkasse allows you to set your bank address to outside Germany when you exit.

## Misconceptions

* **Trains are always on time** - No, keep a 2 hour buffer time in addition to what google maps tells you, if you have an important flight to catch. Trains are delayed all the time, in winter the situation is even worse. Always buy a FLEXPREIS ticket. This ticket guarantees a passage from source to destination through any combination of trains. As long as you are going in the general direction, the ticket checker will let you pass.
* **40% of Germans are proficient in English compared to 10% of Indians** - While technically it might be true, if you visit any shop or restaurant in India, the shopkeeper or waiter knows just enough English to serve you. They cannot hold a fluent conversation but they can conduct the very specific business they do. In Germany, English speaking doctors are very hard to find so maintain a good relationship with your general practitioner (Hauspraxis). Only through Hauspraxis you can be refered to specialists or hospitals. Hospitals have rejected me and asked me to get a letter from Hauspraxis.
* **It is very hard to get fired in Germany** - Unless you are a government employee, it is not true. If you are a government employee then it is true regardless if you are in Germany or not. That being said, it is hard to find IT professionals at competitive salaries, so the borders are gradually being more open for skilled immigrants. 
* **Work is very relaxed/fast** - It was about the same as Bangalore for me.
* **Germans dont have sense of humour** - In informal setting, I have only interacted with Gen X and younger and I havent faced this problem.
* **Racism towards non-Germans** - Not true for Gen X and younger.
* **Overly convoluted bureaucracy** - In my experience it was on par with India.
* **Healthcare is free** - If you do not have a doctor's prescription, it is not free. However buying over the counter medicine will not break your bank. If you get admitted in hospital without a doctor's prescription, then again you have to pay some money. It wont break your bank, but it is something to keep in mind.
* **Lack of vegetarian options** - There are vegan products everywhere in the supermarket.
* **Cost of living is higher** - Cost of living depends on how you live. In Bangalore I used to order biriyanies every other day. I cant afford to order biriyanies every other day 
in Germany because it is a highly specialized exotic food. However, the cost of meat per gram as a fraction of your salary is lower. In other words, meat is cheaper. If you want to cook biriyani in your own home, by yourself, then it is cheaper than if you did the same in India. My disposable income (converted to USD) per month had doubled in Germany than what I used to have in Bangalore. Does that make me twice as rich? It depends on how I spend the disposable income. When I spent the money on buying an oculus quest 2, I was richer. When I spent the money on buying biriyani in an Indian restaurant in Germany, I was poorer.

Overall it made me realize that if you are an IT professional in Bangalore, you are already almost living the 1st world lifestyle.

## Closing thoughts

Overall I liked Germany and if I hadnt gotten a very lucrative offer from USA, I would have stayed. I would definitely recommend it.

Here are some things I would miss
* **Empty trains and trams** - You always get a seat and dont have to sit in a smelly, hot, packed train as you do in India. Ticket checking is rare because the train/tram is almost empty. It probably costs the train company more to keep the checker on payroll than let a few freeloaders pass. Are trains really better for the environment if they are empty all the time? Planes are always fully loaded.
* **Wide streets** - The road to house ratio for land usage is very high compared to India. Perhaps that is another factor which discourages people from crossing the road at red light.The roads are wide and it takes quite a bit of time to cross. Wide roads also allow trams without obstructing car traffic.
* **Chocolate** - It is less thermal resistant (melts in your mouth) and it has something that makes it taste a lot better.
* **Salt** - The salt tastes more salty per gram.
* **Quiet neighbourhoods** - Some people might hate it, but there is a pin drop silence.
* **Temperature** - Cool temperature makes your brain run much faster. I am way more productive here than Bangalore.
* **Cheap Europe trip** - You can take a 2-3 hour train to wherever you want to visit within the Schengen area. I would definitely recommend Rome and Zurich.
